Instruction for those, who forgot all she has coded during the whole BZHD.

1) main.cpp - for lauching integral calculating by both methods
2) rectangles.cpp - rectangle calculating
3) trapetions.cpp - trapetion calculating
4) fucntion.cpp - the poor function I'm executing
5) head.h - the namings of all functions used
6) analyt_integral.cpp - function which returns analytically calculated integral

Instruction how to build a project from these files:
1. Make a new project in VS Studio 2008
2. Put head.h to the "Head files" folder (or it is called smth like that). 
All folders of the project located in the upper left corner of the screen.
3. Put the rest files to the 3rd folder (maybe it's called "Source", I don't remember)
4. Run "main.cpp"
5. Relax
6. Take it easy
